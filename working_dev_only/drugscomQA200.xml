    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">You should discuss this with your Dr before stopping any medications on your own. Pancreatitis happens in people who are on no medications at all so it is not necessarily caused by your medications. Definitely DO NOT stop Norvasc without talking to your physician. If there is reason to stop, they will let you know and advise you how to do so. Ask your Dr about why you got chronic pancreatitis. He may or may not know. Sometimes people get pancreatitis for no apparent reasons. Pancreatitis may be caused by gallstones (by blocking the pancreatic duct outlet), chronic alcohol use, trauma, medications, infections, tumors, and genetic abnormalities. Chronic pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas that does not heal or improve - it gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. Chronic pancreatitis, like acute pancreatitis, occurs when digestive enzymes attack the pancreas and nearby tissues, causing episodes of pain. Chronic pancreatitis often develops in people who are between the ages of 30 and 40.; The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is many years of heavy alcohol use. The chronic form of pancreatitis can be triggered by one acute attack that damages the pancreatic duct. The damaged duct causes the pancreas to become inflamed. Scar tissue develops and the pancreas is slowly destroyed.; Other causes of chronic pancreatitis are; •hereditary disorders of the pancreas; •cystic fibrosis - the most common inherited disorder leading to chronic pancreatitis; •hypercalcemia - high levels of calcium in the blood; •hyperlipidemia or hypertriglyceridemia - high levels of blood fats; •some medicines; •certain autoimmune conditions; •unknown causes&#10;Hereditary pancreatitis can present in a person younger than age 30, but it might not be diagnosed for several years. Episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea lasting several days come and go over time and can progress to chronic pancreatitis. A diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis is likely if the person has two or more family members with pancreatitis in more than one generation.&#10;Treatment for chronic pancreatitis may require hospitalization for pain management, IV hydration, and nutritional support. Nasogastric feedings may be necessary for several weeks if the person continues to lose weight.; When a normal diet is resumed, the doctor may prescribe synthetic pancreatic enzymes if the pancreas does not secrete enough of its own. The enzymes should be taken with every meal to help the person digest food and regain some weight. The next step is to plan a nutritious diet that is low in fat and includes small, frequent meals. A dietitian can assist in developing a meal plan. Drinking plenty of fluids and limiting caffeinated beverages is also important.; People with chronic pancreatitis are strongly advised not to smoke or consume alcoholic beverages, even if the pancreatitis is mild or in the early stages.; Complications; People with chronic pancreatitis who continue to consume large amounts of alcohol may develop sudden bouts of severe abdominal pain.; As with acute pancreatitis, ERCP is used to identify and treat complications associated with chronic pancreatitis such as gallstones, pseudocysts, and narrowing or obstruction of the ducts. Chronic pancreatitis also can lead to calcification of the pancreas, which means the pancreatic tissue hardens from deposits of insoluble calcium salts. Surgery may be necessary to remove part of the pancreas.; In cases involving persistent pain, surgery or other procedures are sometimes recommended to block the nerves in the abdominal area that cause pain.; When pancreatic tissue is destroyed in chronic pancreatitis and the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, called beta cells, have been damaged, diabetes may develop. People with a family history of diabetes are more likely to develop the disease. If diabetes occurs, insulin or other medicines are needed to keep blood glucose at normal levels. A health care provider works with the patient to develop a regimen of medication, diet, and frequent blood glucose monitoring.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">If you aren't taking it on a regular basis, you should be ok, but be sure to tell your obstetrician that you took it before you knew you were pregnant. Many women do things before they know they're pregnant that wouldn't have done otherwise, and most babies do ok.; I was on Vicodin early in my second pregnancy before I knew I was pregnant and my baby was fine. Like KM says, be sure to let your Dr know. If you still need the medication, ask if it is ok to take it. If he says no then dont take anymore. It is most dangerous when taken for long periods of time close to delivery because your baby can be born dependent and may have withdrawals. If you can stand it, it is best not to take anything when you are pregnant. Some medications can be used under the supervision of your OB so be sure to discuss it with him/her. Congratulations on your coming little one!</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">No as you have to replace cortisone that your body doesn't produce. Doing that alters the response to it in that its a hormone you need, not one you're taking over what you already have. In this way, its side effects are less. It could very easily have nothing to do with the diabetes. And 5mg is a tiny dose.; Hello. Long term prednisone can produce medically induced diabetes. It can be controlled with diet or insulin. However, at 5mg without the additional hormone production of the body, it would be minimal influence. If you have experienced weight gain during these years, that alone could push you into diabetes. Say you gained thirty pounds in thirty years. That would do it. If very slow weight gain, it would sneak up on you.; I have read about this condition regarding tumors of the pituitary. There are additional hormones you take, aren't there? They may be a combination of med that can cause the diabetes. What is your endocrinologist saying about this? Regardless of these, control of diabetes at any level is essential. Borderline does have to be treated so that if you become ill or harmed, you can heal faster.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">henrym52,&#10;Does your husband's doctor know about the rash? Where is the rash? If it is someplace other than his face, he can soak in a bath with epsom salts or oatmeal. They will ease the itch. Benadryl would be beneficial for the rash and itch, as well. According to drugs.com interactions checker, benadryl does not cause any interactions with the drugs your husband takes. I would start at 25mg of benadryl and if necessary, increase to 50mg. He should take it exactly as directed on the box/bottle. I have multiple myeloma, too, but was never given Cytoxan. I got Thalidomide and Velcade with either Dex or Decadron. My doctor ordered that I take benadryl before every infusion. You should talk to his doctor about this rash. Watch for swelling of the face, neck, tongue, lips. If this swelling occurs, get him to an ER immediately. I recommend that you read what drugs.com says about Cytoxan on the above drop-down link, Drugs A-Z. There is quite a long list of side effects, some common and some serious. It's best to be well informed.

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Absolutely, you can try again. Synvisc injections are normally given in sets of three. One injection doesn't normally build up enough of a cushion to be of much help. One injection, once a week, allows the fluid to spread and settle. The following injection will build on the previous one, building more of a cushion. The third injection finishes thickening the cushion. Of course, if you're down to walking &quot;bone on bone&quot; then the injections will not work anywhere near as well as they will if you still have some natural cartilage left in the joint. I hope this helps and encourages you to try again!&#10;Lisa</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Wow that is a loaded question that can not be done justice in this space. Mayo clinic is having a hard time keeping up with all the new drugs. The best things are things you can control like diet and weight. Frequent blood sugars and keeping it under 110. American diabetic Association has tons of stuff on their website and material you can order. And finally nothing can beat a good diabetic Dr.; Medications for diabetes control can be expensive. So can the test strips, needles or syringes and so forth. The best savings are diet, exercise, weight control amd knowledge. Type2 diabetes can be controlled if weight is normal and diet is careful. Something we can all do. Relying upon a medicine to correct our over eating just doesn't make sense. I take insulin because of medically induced diabetes type2. Am allergic to the current medications. My choice is simple and I have become accustomed to this. Something to consider when looking at a different medication.</Data></Cell>

Have you discussed other pain med options with your doctor? Something that will actually dissolve and help your pain?; I can tell you that the Oxycontin brand formulation is far more potent than the regular IR 30/40/60/etc.This is well known, if you body wasn't breaking down the OP version naturally, their are some known supplements that will help it breakdown better in your stomach/digestive system. Acidity drinks, grapefruit juice, orange juice, and other fruit-juices will most definitely speed the breakdown of the time release.

But the muscle rigidity can be very painful!&#10;Lara&#10;P.S. I've just gone thru this myself, so I know how it feels.; When you see the doctor, be sure to have a blood test to measure Vit D levels, calcium, magnesium electrolytes. When taking medications and dealing with pain, these areas are easily depleted. They are also leading causes for general leg cramping. Once I got enough of these and in balance, even with my muscle disease, I no longer experience leg and foot cramps. I have been on gabapentin. Discuss.

Passion flower and a med like zoloft together could cause increased drowsiness and decreased breathing. If you try it, do it when he can be watched for effects.; I'd speak with his psychologist but I take medications similar and if you search for interactions between the 2 it basically says it may increase the side effects of the prescription medication such as drowsiness, fatigue etc which I'm ok with since I take them both at night and would prefer to sleep well so drowsiness would help! But I'd say research appropriate dosages for passionflower (Dr. Axe's site has info!) And usibg those guides just give it a shot and keep a journal of any complaints or side effects he has for which dose and adjust uo or down depending on how it is going.

We'll work through this together.&#10;pickles503; According to one website you (and I) can expect to pass away 10 to 20 years earlier than a healthy person, some websites put it shorter and some say no difference.; Me, I believe it depends on how bad your condition is. I now have diabetes and osteoporosis as complications, in addition to consistently having severe vitamin deficiencies. So, I expect my life to be on the shorter end of those predictions...; Now for some good news, a research lab has developed a medical 3d printer and have already printed a small scale printed pancreas and other researchers have developed mechanical systems to manage diabetes. This will likely mean no real difference in life span. Last months nuts and volts had an article on the 3d printer. And then there is the recent advances in stem cell research. We live in a remarkable time and should never lose hope that things are always becoming better. All the life span studies are from before any of these break throughs.; Jon; I was diagnosed with Chronic Pancreatitis almost 6yrs ago and have been suffering horribly since with little to no help or support from anyone in the medical profession (dr's, hospitals,clinics,etc). I have lost 70+lbs and changed my diet drastically. My suggestions are to cut out red meats, spicy, acidic, processed, fatty, fried, raw veggies, alcohol especially). I am basically having chicken, pasta, soups,cereal, crackers, etc). Very bland. My condition is genetic though. I am here for support and suggestions (given by and TO me). People just don't understand the extreme pain and suffering as a result of this condition so i not only offer but am open to the mutual support available. God bless you and keep in touch.</Data></Cell>

Paxil/Paroxetine is very effective in treating anxiety disorders. Be it for panic attacks, GAD etc. Hopefully you will do well on it. Regards pledge; I know how hard it is for you, in fact painful. I've felt hopeless and actually took myself to the hospital. Tried a little of everything myself and finally feel&#10;pretty good on 37.5 of Effexor and 100 of Lamictal but it took 3 years of trying different meds. Xanax gave me some relief. You may not feel like it but getting out helps, especially with other people. Walking is a good natural release. In my case, prayer was a big part of my life.; Cymbalta made me so depressed and my anxiety went through the roof. My doc has me on Sertraline and it is working much better so far.&#10;All you can do is keep trying til you hit the right med. &#10;I know it is hard but it is not hopeless and you are not hopeless either.&#10;I have some pretty strange reactions to meds - as in they effect me opposite to what they are supposed to do - so don't give up.&#10;Take care; I have been on many medications; everyone is and individual as and individual not one medication will work for everyone... it's very difficult to find the correct meds.

Even planning to get together gives me stress and anxiety then when the actual event arrives, I usually don't want to go or find an excuse to back out. I do some things because of my kids but not as much as I should. I get easily irritated, cranky - would rather stay home many times! This website has helped me a lot, thanks to everyone for making me feel not so isolated because my family and friends dont understand! Thank you for expressing yourself on here!

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">(phenteramine) is a appetite suppressant which means people take it to lose weight. It can cause a dangerously high blood pressure which in turn can be a reason for the stroke so the answer yes it can indirectly cause stoke, Sorry about your friend I hope they get well; Your friend, having had a TIA, has about a 35% chance of having a full stroke within the next 5 years. So be sure that she talks to a doctor about things that she should do to avoid having that stroke. The doctor will probably tell her to monitor her blood pressure and not to smoke. There are other things as well. Plus have her tell her family to watch out for any stroke symptoms. I am very tuned in to my body and didn't have any idea that paralysis on one side of my body and not being able to talk were major red flags. Strokes can impair any judgment. So it's important for anyone close to her to know to call an ambulance immediately so that she can possibly get a medication which will undo the stroke disabilities. Good luck to her.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Lorazepam. A blood sample shows .50 ng /mL?</Data></Cell>
    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Ativan has a half life of 10 to 20 hours which means the dose is reduced by half each 20 hours. So any dose is detectable in a screen for 4 to 8 days. It is a very long lasting drug that is not weight dependent. If you have liver and kidney problems it can take longer.; Benzodiazepines are metabolized by the liver and absorbed by the stomach. So your weight does not matter. Any amount down to one quarter of a milligram will show up in a drug test up to 30 days and as far as being in your system the half life on Lorazepam is something like 14 hours so it will take about 3.5 to 4 days for it to clear your system.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The aPTT level is not the test you should be using to determine enoxaparin levels. There is a high degree of variability in aPTT readings from one laboratory to another, and even from one reagent to another. Given that several biologic factors can influence the aPTT independent of the effects of LMWH, institutions should be transitioning to monitoring enoxaparin with antifactor Xa levels, rather than the aPTT or PT. The peak and trough levels of about 1.2 and 0.52 IU/mL, respectively are typical of the steady state range. Based on enoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics, this difference in steady state is expected and within the therapeutic range.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">I have been cursed with this for going on 9 years and the medication that has worked for me is Amitriptline. Has she been diagnosed by a doctor? BMS is extremely difficult to diagnose and few doctors have even heard of it.; Hi. I also have had BMS for a number of years, it came out of the blue and really it is an unknown syndrome. I am under Eastmans and Queens Sq Hosp in London and the only medication that helps me is Amitriptyline. I sometimes think it may have gone and have twice stopped the medication, then after a few days I know for sure it is still there. The burning and all the symptons are rather aggressive. There is no answer from anyone at present but it exists and it can be very painful. Try Amitriptyline, I take five x10mg a day, two when I wake up then two afternoon and one before I go to bed, the only downside is that they can make your mouth very dry at times. You can spread the dosage for your own requirements. It does help to calm the BMS down. No one can say what causes it or if and when it will disappear. It can make you feel rather antisocial at times. Good luck and try the amitriptyline. Regards June</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">You should call your doctor about your side effects, especially the itching. If the itching gets bad, I would call the on-call doctor to ask about discontinuing it. I just looked up the side effects of Butrans and didn't see anything about weight gain, but anything is possible. I myself have never had any weight gain from taking 15 mcg. But maybe somebody else will respond who has. Itching occurred in 4% of people taking Butrans during the drug trial. If it hasn't helped your pain at all, it may not be worth it, but again, ask your doctor. Good luck.; when on butrans,you need to eat drink and rest properly. lots of water and maybe something for bowl movements. now that your not in pain you want to eat and exersize even if its just stretching. eat smart only when you need to. get ride of all them snacks and cut down on salt... give that a try. but when I got on bup same thing happened to me. extra weight is a killer for people in pain... good luck subzero58; Hi Ginabru&#10;I have been on the patches for over a year now, and whilst I can't say they made me gain weight, they certainly contribute to making it harder for me to lose weight. Just stick to a diet plan - whichever suits you eg weight watchers and get as much exercise as you can. I also have knee arthritis (about to have more surgery on knee cap) as just one of my health issues, and am overweight too, so empathise. Also, get your doctor to prescribe a steroid cream for the itching and rashes - I always use a steroid cream before I add the patch. Try also using the patch on your back, it is my least itchy area! I get too many rashes if I use it anywhere else on my body.</Data></Cell>

The problem I've faced is Cymbalta cannot just be stopped-you must ween yourself off of it very slowly.&#10; Take it from me, the weening off process has been harder for me than any medication, including extremely strong narcotics I've taken for numerous severe surgeries. The withdrawals are horrendous, thus it has been labeled, &quot;Cymbalta Withdrawal syndrome&quot;. There actually is a class action lawsuit at this time against Eli Lilly-the makers of Cymbalta, for numerous cases involving &quot;brain zaps&quot;, &amp; for w/holding serious information regarding patients who need to discontinue usage.&#10; Just please do your research if you continue Cymbalta usage. Cymbalta alone did NOT help w/my Fibro pain, &amp; after 8yrs of usage I wish I never started taking it. I'm currently battling severe anxiety, agitation, short term memory loss, worsening pain then I had prior to usage, atrocious sweating, shaking, fainting episodes, as well as numerous other side effects I could write a book!!!

Side effects are minimal compared to the two benzodiazepines where waking up with a drug hangover for example is common. Regards pledge; Hi homar,&#10;I must agree with pledge. But, have you noticed that gabapentin makes you a bit hyper? I couldn't sleep on that stuff until my body adjusted to each increase in the dose. That stuff wound me up like a cheap watch! &#10;Look back thru your history, could it have been the gabapentin? I didn't realize my insomnia was caused by my gab until my last dose increase then it was very apparent that gabapentin was the culprit. I've Fibromyalgia and just can't take much gab any more, way too hyper on the stuff. pledge may be right about the trazadone, if you've not already tried it.&#10;Wish you ZZZZZZZZ's,&#10;Lara; homar, I'm glad you wrote in, and know you came to the right place for advice. I too take Gagapentin, but Lamictal for a mood stabilizer. I too, struggled with severe insomnia, and your just not the same if you don't get enough sleep. Some sleeping meds. help you fall asleep, and others help you fall asleep, and stay asleep. I tried them all in a desperate attempt for some sleep.

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Stop abusing the med. You can take up to 400 mg a day. Tramadol isn't like other pain meds but keeps trying to use it the same way. I've found the only way it works is if you take it on a regular basis. It won't help if you take it when you have severe pain. It has to be able to prevent the pain. Taking more then 100 mg isn't going to help any better. I take 100 mg every 6 hrs and I have some relief that way. The side effects you're having will go away as the drug decreases in your system. Don't take any more until you feel better.; Hi claudis0101,&#10;Don't abuse Tramadol unless you are ready to have a seizure! You lower your seizure threshold every time you take more than what was prescribed. I'm really quite surprised that you didn't have one after taking 300mgs of the stuff.&#10;You need to talk to your doc if you can't take Tram as prescribed, as kaismama has said, you need to tell your doctor they aren't strong enough, but you may just be labeled as a drug-seeker, it's worth a shot if you have pain that isn't being touched by 300mgs of Tramadol! &#10;If you've a good rapport with your doctor than bring this subject up to her/him. &#10;Lara; Hi, i know how it feels when you have severe pain that you can get rid of. Desperation can make you do dangerous things. I've been there, i understand the frustration. However, like the other ladies have said, Tramadol is best taken as prescribed, usually 100mg 4 x a day (for the 50mg immediate release capsules). If you take it regularly throughout the day, on a daily basis, you should notice that your pain becomes much more manageable. I'm hoping you are feeling better now after the overdose?? You can take Paracetamol &amp;/or Ibuprofen alongside Tramadol if you need extra help every now and then (as long as you don't have problems taking these medications). I hope you are feeling better soon!</Data></Cell>

Have you tried the older antidepressants?; Hi there,; I tried a lot of meds for my major depression. Then I tried Manerix with Lithium and had success!; Good luck!; Smileyhappy; Hi, as already stated, it takes time for the antidepressants to work effectively at a level that will control your depression. Your body needs to get used to them, and yes, it can take 4 weeks to settle down, sometimes longer. Try not to let this put your off, as long term treatment can be a God send. I started an antidepressant (Citalopram) some years ago now. The transition period was really hard, i felt worsening depression, low energy/desire to do anything, lethargy, etc. But i got through it and i'm so, so glad i did. I hope you find the right medication for you, and start to live a happier life : ); a very wise dr i used to go to told me about health store grade lithium and i have been taking that instead of a script anti-depressant for yrs. (6 or 7... don't remember for sure) it has helped me in some real dark times and i don't feel awful starting out. the manufacturers should have a recommended dosage on the bottle. it takes a day or two to kick in but it's definitely worth it. hope this helps.</Data></Cell>

I have already had one hip replacement and that has improved my pain immensely. I still have one hip to go but sitting for long periods is really painful. So getting up and moving around is helpful - so is walking. Even slow walking is better than no walking. Aquatic exercises have helped as well.

Hope my answer may help anyone further:; CAREFUL with Micronor!&#10;So you had a delay of 2h45 in taking your Micronor pil: you should carry on taking the daily pil as usual until the end of your sachet: you should get your periods. Then start a new sachet: you should then be protected again. Until you start this new sachet (and it's not long to wait as you almost finished your sachet), I would strongly advise you use extracontraception (condom) up to the end of your cycle - and certainly not 7 days as said on the leaflet (nor 2 days as I think it has been revised now - as a recommendation after a delay of more than 3 hours): it is not reliable AT ALL!; In case my experience may prevent such stories happen to someone else, believe my poor experience: I had a delay of 2H45 in taking my Micronor like you, and had an &quot;unprotected&quot; intercourse the day after. I followed the leaflet instructions AS WELL AS many doctors advices that were: &quot;you should be fine&quot; so no morning-after-pil and only 2 days extra-contraception: as a result I had to face an unexpected pregnancy...; From now with my experience and after collecting different advice on micro-pil such as Micronor with a &quot;3 hours delay&quot;, You should consider you are not protected anymore of an unwanted pregnancy from 1 hour delay only. Be aware you should not be sick either (vomit or diarrhea in the next 3-4 hours). Also avoid to take at night time (before going to bed: it shorten the delay): be fully aware it is a MICRO-pil, so it is less powerful on a time frame: it has to be strickly taken every 24 hours: and it is not easy to respect... &#10;Then perhaps you'd rather swap for another pil or meaning of contraception (cerazette (12 hours), IUD or hormonal IUD mirena, implant) (some estroprogestative pils may also be fine for you).

It was first prescribed to help the pain and insomnia i experienced due to a back injury. I now continue to take it to help with sleep. It is a very 'safe' medication to be used for sleep, compared to a lot of others.; I use it for sleep, but on an every day basis. Works well. I'm not sure how it would work taking it here and there. It took me awhile to adjust to the sleepiness. Also works somewhat as a pain reliever, especially for bladder pain. And my mother called it her &quot;Happy Pill&quot;. It worked great as an antidepressant for her. Regards - EJ23</Data></Cell>

Now I'm on 2 days without and during the day it hurts much worse at night. Good luck!; So does Norco cause leg cramps or not? I'm currently taking it post op total knee replacement after the doc wanted me to come off the Percocet I was taking ... I take 2 mg. Klonopin (clonazepam) and 75 mg. Trazodone for my restless leg syndrome ... this question peaked my interest as I had some leg cramping issues last night that really surprised me since the Klonopin/Trazodone combo has almost resolved all of it ... but this was also the same day as I had therapy and when I came home I was in my hot tub for about 45 minutes ... maybe doing to much in one day caused the leg cramping? I do ice when I sleep ... any thoughts?</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">You should not start any diet without consulting with your doctor. You are on medication that is based on your caloric intake now. I hope you don't plan on doing anything if you're on that low of calories, its not enough to keep you moving and can lead to a dangerous condition called acidosis.; That level of diet is going to cause you trouble. See a dietician after you talk with your physician. You can't do it all at once and a crash diet like this will give you a huge rebound effect of even more weight. Slow and steady gets and keeps results. Please don't start this diet until your medication is adjusted. Low sugar readings are deadly, you know.; dear murrypuss, i am NOT a doctor, but 450 calories a day??? That is NOT enough, even for a well person. Just 6 months ago I was paralyzed from neck down by potassium levels too low. Was told it could have affected organs next had I not rec'd treatment when I did. Your body will not react well with that few calories, hon, and can be very dangerous. Please talk to someone before you start this...; You need more then 450 calories a day; I totally agree with every answer above! That is not enough calories for anyone. Much less a diabetic. You are going to feel fatigue and tired. That sounds dangerous to me. I would consult my Physician and increase my calories with veggies and fiber at least. Foods that are good for your body. hope this helped, I am definitely not a doctor. But that is not the proper way to lose weight. Well wishes and good luck.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Leeguinn,&#10;I thankfully do not have this type of cancer, so I had to research a little bit on drugs.com. It says:; &quot;Definition: Malignant tumor of the liver that develops in the setting of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma is derived from hepatocytes that are transformed into adenocarcinoma. Up to 60% of patients with HCC have elevated serum alpha fetoprotein levels. Tumor has a poor long-term prognosis unless treated surgically by resection or liver transplantation. Noninvasive imaging (e.g., MRI or CT scan) may distinguish hepatomas from other benign tumors such as hemangiomas.&quot;; I interpret this to mean that in some cases the tumor can be removed. If yours can be surgically resected, then you could have chemo and radiation for the smaller lesions. Your doctor would know your individual case better than anyone though. So, please have a long &quot;sit down&quot; with him/her. I wish you the very best outcome and will keep you in my prayers. I've been in your shoes, and I know how scary it is. I did not have liver cancer, but cancer of the plasma cells (multiple myeloma). Keep your chin up and take one day at a time. We can't worry about what might happen tomorrow until it comes. Stay strong and let us know if you need us. Our DC Family is very knowledgeable, caring and supportive. Lean on us!&#10;Your friend,&#10;Kathy; Hello. Kathy is so right. Be sure you get another opinion. If the cancer has become metastatic your options are more limited. Hope you have the talk very soon. Good luck with getting the right plan for you.

This is not normal response. You may well be having a reaction to the surgery, an infection, or some other response. Since thyroid medication takes a long time to change your system you may be having something else going on. Drink lots of water. If you get worse best to go to the ER and be checked out. Dont wait on this. If you having any signs of bleeding or very light headed, Be sure to go right away.; Give it time. It may take 3 to 4 weeks for you to fully recover.; Hi bmshell,; I had my out too. It takes awhile to adjust. It took me a year to get to the right level because I was supressed because I had thyroid cancer. When you feel shaky usually means your dose is too high. Give it a few days and call your Endo to discuss. If you feel worse call right away. You also call the pharmacist for info. too.; Take care,; Smileyhappy</Data></Cell>

Sometimes I had to use a pad along with a tampon to avoid those embarrassing breakthrough moments.; I can tell you that walking helps the cramps and so does coffee. I always could tell when my period was coming by my caffeine cravings. It did help with the cramps. Sometimes I had to take motrin or something like that. For some women... menstrual pain and bleeding is severe enough to require a trip to the ob/gyn. I suffered a miscarriage, for instance, that mimicked a period that just wouldn't stop. I mean two weeks later I am still bleeding. But that is how some miscarriages go. Some women are prescribed birth control to control the severity of those symptoms as well as the duration.; By the way... changing a tampon in one hour isn't abnormal. I thought it was much easier to wear a pad because for me it was more predictable. I had many a leak with those teenie weenie plugs and still needed a pad any way.; If you are truly concerned then perhaps seeing your ob/gyn is in order. You don't also have endometreosis do you???

I took Paxil when I had post pardom depression and it made me awake. I thought I was all better and quit taking it, cold turkey. If you do stop taking Paxil, don't stop right away, ask your doc about the taper off plan. I was never so ill getting off a medication as I was from Paxil but it was my first anti-depressant and I didn't know you had to taper off of them unless Dr. tells you is okay. Good luck!; different anti depressants react differently on people. What suits one person may not suit another.; You need to go to your doctor and discuss this. We cannot comment on what medication you should take.; I have been on Effexor 150mg 9 years and it is the best anti-depressant I have been on. I have no side effects except weight gain. Be warned, however, it is a very difficult medication to withdraw from.; Talk to your doctor, of course. I found Effexor XR to be very effective in combating my depression and anxiety. However, it can be a very hard drug to come off of. My current doctor said she would not have prescribed it to me, except that I was already on it when I moved to her practice. You might see if there are other alternatives with less severe withdrawal effects to try first.; As a side note, I experienced both hypertension and erectile dysfunction while on Effexor. Those are major reasons why I want to stop taking it. Not everyone experiences those effects, of course, but be aware they do occur.</Data></Cell>

I too would say tell your dr.; Hi Athar143,&#10; I hope you are doing better and I just thought I would add my 2 cents.&#10; It's been my experience that pain is always for a reason. Do you have a fever, lack of appetite, nausea or any other symptoms? Endometriosis started that way... I thought it was a yeast infection and things turned bad very fast... got a high fever, dizzy, light headed, and couldn't eat. I wish I went to the doctors sooner. But I have had ovarian cysts and I find them quite painful. Most of these cysts go away on their own but I suffered while they were here. &#10;Hope this helps; Hello. Some women are very sensitive to ovulation. I would often find I knew when I was ovulating when a quick sharp pain would happen.; However, I also had fibroid tumors which would flare up with my cycle. Some would grow larger and hurt. Since these are benign we tended to watch them and see how they were doing. So I suggest you go to a gynecologist to be examined. My general doctor did not catch it and I had a lot of troubles because of it. Usually they do an ultrasound, take a look and keep watch. It does not mean a hysterectomy. They never become cancer and will shrink with age.; Another possibility is an ovarian cyst. These hurt like crazy, double you over and should be seen by a doctor or ER right away. The pain is from internal bleeding and can affect future fertility. So when in doubt, see someone now.; Any or all of these are possibilities. Women are complex. See the gynecologist and sort out what is going on. You will be much better for it. Karen</Data></Cell>

Prednisone 10 mg for 2 weeks isn't a very high dose. Its not going to hurt you.; I agree. I used to get poison ivy every summer. Nasty stuff. The creams simply don't go into the blood streams enough to cause a problem. Prednisone is very low dose. Hope it clears quickly for you. And do not use a calamine lotion on it with an antihistamine. Makes the rash worse,; Just a fun fact. Cat tails which are often found near water cures poison Ivy almost instantly. You break the stalk in half and the milky fluid found inside is rubbed over the area. When I was a scout we rubbed poison ivy on our arm and when the itching started we rubbed the milk on our arms. It stopped the itching almost immediately. Another proven home cure is putting wet tobacco on the site of a bee sting. It stops the pain within minutes.</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">First let me clear up a myth for you. While birth control is very effective if taken without fail and as directed, take Drs advice concerning missed days. Drs usually advise to use a condom when you first start on birth control. Second withdrawing before ejaculation is a VERY unreliable form of birth control as a women can get pregnant on pre-ejaculation which biologically speaking acts as a way for the sperm to more easily swim upstream. The only way to find out is by doing a home pregnancy test.; There is a slim chance you are pregnant. If you're taking it perfectly it is 99% effective. Don't worry about it until you are thru the inactive pills. Plan B was not needed and you shouldn't have taken it. It will mess up your cycle. You're already taking extra hormones and now you've added more to it. The pill is the most effective form of birth control, If I worried about pregnant so much I felt I needed more then just that, I think I'd give up sex.</Data></Cell>

My pdoc is pretty good with that stuff, for instance. I wouldn't even offer another suggestion without knowing what that person is being treated for. Are you trying to go with compounded? You won't get that compounded, by the way. So have you tried to get a script filled at a regular pharmacy and the cost is prohibitive - to high?; Can you give more information please...; Mary; Hi - I get 7 of my medications compounded, pay for them out-of-pocket and submit them to my insurance for reimbursement. Very expensive! The only way my insurer will pay is if I have a documented allergy to an ingredient that is present in all the different brand name and generics of that medication or to those similar to it. The research is outrageous! Pharmacies help some but don't have the time to research much - so I do it. Anyway, without an allergy it isn't likely they will pay. There are many different manufacturers of this medication. Have you asked the pharmacy to try a different manufacturer or go to another pharmacy for one? There are so many different inactive ingredients - each med contains the same active ingredient, but the inactives can make it an entirely different med. usually a med that has generics is made by 4 or 5 different companies. Go to pillbox.com, the one by NIH, and search the med there and you will see. And if your client can get approval to see an allergist perhaps he/she can find out the source of the problem. Another option might be to try a different pain med, even Oxycodone with a lower strength. Regards - ElizaJane</Data></Cell>
